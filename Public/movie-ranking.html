     <h1>The Best Movies According to Lee</h1>
     <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
     <hr />
     <h3>Saving Private Ryan</h3>
     <p>Amazing story that is well told and has incredible cinematography; however, I never want to see it again.</p>
     <h3>Idiocracy</h3>
     <p>A terrifyingly close to the truth satire of our culture.</p>
      <h3>Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom</h3>
     <p>I grew up in the 80's.  Of course this is one of my favorites. </p>
