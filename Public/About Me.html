       <p>I love learning and have already lived many career lives.  I have been an electrical engineer, an anesthesiologist and a manufacturing business owner.  Each career has allowed me to expand my breadth and depth of knowledge.  Now my focus is on web design, pulling strongly from my electircal engineering background which included programming in Basic, Fortran and Pascal.  I am looking forward to combining creativity with logic.</p>
